Please see https://github.com/kundajelab/modisco_private/blob/master/examples/simulated_tf_binding/TF%20MoDISco%20TAL%20GATA.ipynb for a self-contained example notebook that uses pre-computed importance scores as inputs. See https://github.com/kundajelab/tfmodisco/blob/master/examples/simulated_tf_binding/Generate%20Importance%20Scores.ipynb for an example notebook demonstrating how to compute such scores using DeepLIFT.

Paper on the way.
